# FEI .emd microscopy file image processor and analysis
----------------------

## **Authors:** Aviral Vaid and Frederic Houlle

Basic python module to quickly produce images and data out of an FEI .emd microscope data file,
which contains both a simple image and spectral data on chemical element concentrations.

Built for a tutorial given in April 2018, and also for fun.
